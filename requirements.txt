xpress9 # Added for PBIXRay
# Note: PBIXRay also requires the 'xpress9' decompression library.
# This is typically a compiled library (C/C++ with Python bindings).
# You will need to ensure it's installed in your environment.
# The 'xpress9.py' file in PBIXRay is a Python interface to this library.
# Installation might involve: pip install xpress9 (if available on PyPI)
# or installing from a specific wheel file.
